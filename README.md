# Android popup webview handler
This is an Android Studio project showing how to handle popups in Android Webview. 
Most open source browsers do not support opening popups.

Popups are especially important in OAuth login used in a lot of websites (e.g., www.feedly.com). 
The popups in this project open in a dialog and can be dismissed by a close button or pressing Back or the popup window closes itself (like what happens on most login authentication flow).
